## ABSTRACT
Brain tumors pose a serious risk since they can cause damage and compression to critical brain regions. They are generally categorized as meningeal tumors (non-malignant) and glioma (malignant). Conventional diagnostic techniques frequently prove laborious, obstructing timely intervention. The goal of this initiative is to use machine learning techniques to accelerate tumor identification. Ten different machine learning models are built and extensively tested using a dataset containing chemical profiles unique to meningeal tumors and gliomas (graded according to severity). These models are: Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Fast Large Margin (FLM), Deep Learning (DL), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Evolutionary Heterogeneous Decision Tree (EvoHDTree). After a thorough assessment using performance indicators like Accuracy (ACC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC), and F1-score, the ability of these models to distinguish between people who are healthy and those who have carcinoma is compared. Moreover, the best-performing EvoHDTree model (ACC = 0.9195) is improved using a new preprocessing technique that uses the ADASYN up-sampling algorithm. This improvement produces the final model that has increased accuracy in identifying malignant from non-malignant tumors.
